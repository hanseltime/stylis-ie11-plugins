# Stylis-IE11-Plugins

This repository serves as a monorepo for any stylis plugins that might be used to help walk back css to be ie11 compliant.

It's main motivation came out of a desire to be able to use chakra-ui v1 with ie11.

Please review individual packages for an understanding of each plugin.
